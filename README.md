## ![sofe_group](./public/herobg.png)

Welcome to the official github repository for the Sofe group

## Development

This app was created NextJs, TailwindCSS, and ReactJs

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sofe-group/sofe-next.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
